### Very Very Fun Refactor Challenge!

Go through this small login form and fix any problems you find, and make it something you'd be happy to ship (were it actually integrated in some webapp). 

Anything goes, pretend the form has been created by a backend developer. :see_no_evil:

#### Running the app

This is just a tiny little app created with `create-react-app`. You can get it up and running by cloning this repo, installing the dependencies (run `yarn` or `npm i` if you don't have yarn), and then running `yarn start` (or `npm start`).

### Checklist

- Clone this repo locally
- Do your thing
- Zip up the folder, and send it back to us
